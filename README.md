### Elevator pitch
Are you tired of spending more time debating with friends about which movie to watch than actually enjoying the movie itself? Here’s a movie voting application to streamline your decision-making process and eliminate arguments! Just answer four quick questions: What genre? What time period? What age rating? What length? Then, the app will generate the top five rated films from IMDB that meet your specific criteria. Each member of your group then gets to cast their vote for their preferred movie. The app automatically tallies the votes and displays the results in real time for everyone to see. With a clear consensus, you can confidently choose the movie that the majority of your group is excited to watch. Movies are for entertainment, not endless decision-making – let this app bring the joy back to your movie nights!
