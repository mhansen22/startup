## GitHub Notes - 1/12/24:

### Creating and Cloning a Repository:

**Create a Repository on GitHub:**
  - Name: 'startup'
  - Public, with a default README.md and license.
  
**Clone Repository to Local Environment:**
  - git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example.git
  - cd startup

### Making Changes to a File:

If the file is called test.md:
- printf "\nChange from my development environment!\n" >> test.md
- git add test.md
- git commit -am "update(notes) thoughts about startup applications"
- git push

This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process:
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

Fetch: will get the latest information about the changes on GitHub without changing the local repository (see the differences between the clones and missing a commit). 

Pull: pull it down using the pull Git command.

EX:

➜  git fetch
➜  git status
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

➜  git pull
Updating d13a9ce..cafe81a
Fast-forward
 test.md | 4 +++-
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

 ### Creating an AWS server instance:

The process of creating an AWS server instance involves the following steps:

1. Log in to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. Change the region to US East (N. Virginia) for availability of the required Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
3. Launch an instance, giving it a meaningful name and using a specified AMI ID (ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed).
4. Choose the instance type (t3.nano, t3.micro, or t2.micro) based on power requirements and eligibility for a free usage tier.
5. Create or select a key pair for secure shell (SSH) access to the server.
6. Configure network settings, ensuring auto-assign public IP address is enabled and setting up firewall rules (security group) to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic.
7. Optionally, for T3 class servers, adjust the credit specification to Unlimited in Advanced details.
8. Launch the instance and wait for it to start. Obtain the public IP address.
9. Access the web server using the public IP address in a browser to confirm successful setup.

*** Note: The AWS interface may change over time, and users are advised to adapt to current interface variations.

### HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates

HTTPS and TLS:
- HTTPS involves a negotiated secure connection using the TLS protocol
- TLS encrypts data, enhancing security during data exchange between clients and servers

Web Certificates:
- Web certificates, generated by trusted third parties, play a crucial role
- They use public/private key encryption to verify the ownership of a domain

Let's Encrypt and ACME Protocol:
- Let's Encrypt, a non-profit, revolutionized the industry by providing free and trusted web certificates
- ACME protocol facilitates the dynamic generation and renewal of certificates

Modern Browser Expectations:
- Modern browsers prioritize HTTPS, and the next version of HTTP (v3) supports only secure connections

Caddy Integration:
- Caddy, the web service used, has built-in ACME support
- Tutorial provides steps for configuring Caddy to handle HTTPS requests and obtain certificates

### Hypertext Markup Language

HTML Foundation:
- HTML provides the foundational structure for web applications.
- Originally designed for web documents, it now supports single-page and multi-page applications.

Basic HTML Structure:
- HTML documents consist of elements enclosed in tags.
- Tags provide structure, and elements can be nested within each other.

Attributes:
- Elements can have attributes that provide specific details.
- Common attributes include id and class, written inside the element tag.

Hyperlinks:
- Hyperlinks are represented using the anchor (a) element with an href attribute.
- They enable navigation between pages.

Deployment:
- Use the deployFiles.sh script to deploy to a production environment.
- The script's functions: deleting previous deployments, copying files, and configuring Caddy.

Common HTML Elements:
- HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.

Comments and Special Characters:
- Comments are <!-- and --> in HTML files.
- Entity syntax to escape reserved characters in content.

Rendering HTML:
- Save HTML files locally and open them in a browser for rendering.


### Technology Stack

Technology Stack Definition: A technology stack refers to the collection of technologies used to create or deliver a web application. It typically involves layers of components, with the web framework at the top, followed by web services, backend services, and various tools for authentication, business logic, data, and storage.

Components in a Stack: The web framework (e.g., Angular, React, Vue, Svelte) is at the top, communicating with web services that handle authentication, business processes, data, and storage. Backend services like caching, databases, logging, and monitoring support these web services.

Example Stack: The provided example stack includes React as the web framework, Caddy as the web server on AWS, Node.js for web services, and MongoDB as the database hosted on MongoDB Atlas.

Key Considerations: Choosing the right technology for each stack component is crucial, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Company investments, migration costs, and potential gains in terms of money, performance, or security should be considered. Maximizing effectiveness with existing technology is valuable, and disruptive changes should only be pursued if they offer substantial benefits.

Complex Stacks: In commercial stacks, careful consideration is necessary, taking into account factors like dependability, support, scalability, performance, and security. Development productivity factors, including documentation, ease of use, community support, and testing integration, should also be weighed.

Caution Against Discontent: Discontent with not using the latest technologies may cause unnecessary disruption. It's essential to focus on value and validate changes that could bring significant benefits to the team.

Example of a Complex Tech Stack: Illustrated with a tech stack from a small web application company, emphasizing the importance of selecting components based on various factors for a successful and efficient application.

## CSS Flexbox

CSS Flexbox is a powerful layout model used to create flexible and responsive web designs. It allows for easy arrangement of elements within a container, adjusting dynamically to various screen sizes and orientations.

Key Points:
Deeper Dive Reading: Resources like MDN Flexbox and CSS Tricks provide comprehensive guides on Flexbox concepts and usage.
Flex Layout: Utilizes the flex property to control the behavior of flex items within a flex container.
Header, Main, Footer Layout:
- Header and footer fixed heights: flex: 0 <height>;
- Main area occupying remaining space: flex: 1;
Main Content: Split into two sections using Flexbox.
Responsive Design:
- Utilizes flex-direction and @media queries for responsiveness.
Adjusts layout based on viewport dimensions and orientation changes.

## CSS Frameworks

- CSS frameworks make web development easier with common functions and components.
- They save time by packaging reusable patterns into open-source repositories.
- Bootstrap ensures a consistent user experience across websites.
- Tailwind CSS applies styles directly to HTML elements for a unique approach.
- Bootstrap is popular for its extensive features and ease of use.
- Integration involves linking to CSS files via a CDN.
- JavaScript components can be added from Bootstrap's CDN.
- Bootstrap can be downloaded via NPM for self-hosting.
- Components are implemented easily using predefined CSS classes.
- Components like buttons, navigation bars, and cards improve UI design and work well on different devices.

- To start using Bootstrap, create a new HTML file.
- Include the following meta tag in the <head> section for responsive behavior: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">.
- Link Bootstrap's CSS file by adding this line in the <head> section: <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-rbsA2VBKQhggwzxH7pPCaAqO46MgnOM80zW1RWuH61DGLwZJEdK2Kadq2F9CUG65" crossorigin="anonymous">.
- Include Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle before the closing </body> tag with this line: <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-kenU1KFdBIe4zVF0s0G1M5b4hcpxyD9F7jL+jjXkk+Q2h455rYXK/7HAuoJl+0I4" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>.
- If needed, include Popper for dropdowns, popovers, and tooltips by adding these lines:
