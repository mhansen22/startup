# CS 260 Notes

## GitHub Notes - 1/12/24:

### Creating and Cloning a Repository:

**Create a Repository on GitHub:**
  - Name: 'startup'
  - Public, with a default README.md and license.
  
**Clone Repository to Local Environment:**
  - git clone https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example.git
  - cd startup

### Making Changes to a File:

If the file is called test.md:
- printf "\nChange from my development environment!\n" >> test.md
- git add test.md
- git commit -am "update(notes) thoughts about startup applications"
- git push

This is the pattern that you want to make a reflexive part of your development process:
1. Pull the repository's latest changes from GitHub (git pull)
2. Make changes to the code
3. Commit the changes (git commit)
4. Push the changes to GitHub (git push)

Fetch: will get the latest information about the changes on GitHub without changing the local repository (see the differences between the clones and missing a commit). 

Pull: pull it down using the pull Git command.

EX:

➜  git fetch
➜  git status
Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)

➜  git pull
Updating d13a9ce..cafe81a
Fast-forward
 test.md | 4 +++-
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

 ### Creating an AWS server instance:

The process of creating an AWS server instance involves the following steps:

1. Log in to the AWS console and navigate to the EC2 service.
2. Change the region to US East (N. Virginia) for availability of the required Amazon Machine Image (AMI).
3. Launch an instance, giving it a meaningful name and using a specified AMI ID (ami-0b009f6c56cdd83ed).
4. Choose the instance type (t3.nano, t3.micro, or t2.micro) based on power requirements and eligibility for a free usage tier.
5. Create or select a key pair for secure shell (SSH) access to the server.
6. Configure network settings, ensuring auto-assign public IP address is enabled and setting up firewall rules (security group) to allow SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic.
7. Optionally, for T3 class servers, adjust the credit specification to Unlimited in Advanced details.
8. Launch the instance and wait for it to start. Obtain the public IP address.
9. Access the web server using the public IP address in a browser to confirm successful setup.

*** Note: The AWS interface may change over time, and users are advised to adapt to current interface variations.

### HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates

HTTPS and TLS:
- HTTPS involves a negotiated secure connection using the TLS protocol
- TLS encrypts data, enhancing security during data exchange between clients and servers

Web Certificates:
- Web certificates, generated by trusted third parties, play a crucial role
- They use public/private key encryption to verify the ownership of a domain

Let's Encrypt and ACME Protocol:
- Let's Encrypt, a non-profit, revolutionized the industry by providing free and trusted web certificates
- ACME protocol facilitates the dynamic generation and renewal of certificates

Modern Browser Expectations:
- Modern browsers prioritize HTTPS, and the next version of HTTP (v3) supports only secure connections

Caddy Integration:
- Caddy, the web service used, has built-in ACME support
- Tutorial provides steps for configuring Caddy to handle HTTPS requests and obtain certificates
